# Covid Vaccine Availability

I wanted to do my part for everyone in this second wave, by making some information readily available for everyone. I have created a website for checking the availability of vaccines for a certain pincode at a certain date. I am not the facilitator of this data, this has been provided by the cowin API by API SETU. Some pin codes might not show data available for any date, that's because the data is not available. You might want to try using the following pincode and date - 110001 & 21-05-2021

Feel free to contribute to the source code, improve the UI, add more features! Please add a deployed surge link for a PR.
